# Release workflow for streamdeck-mcp
#
# How it works:
# 1. Create a git tag (e.g., v1.0.0)
# 2. Push the tag to trigger this workflow
# 3. Workflow builds and publishes to PyPI using Trusted Publishing
#
# PyPI Trusted Publishing:
#   No API tokens needed! Configure at:
#   https://pypi.org/manage/project/streamdeck-mcp/settings/publishing/
#   Add this repository as a trusted publisher.
